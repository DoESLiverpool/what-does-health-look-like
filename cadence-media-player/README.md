# Cadence Media Player

Simple ruby code to subscribe to the MQTT data generated by the [sensor_mqtt_publish](../sensor_mqtt_publish) sketch and monitor the pace of steps or pedalling action.

When you get above a given threshold it plays a congratulatory audio wav file, and if you drop below a set threshold then it plays an encouragement.

## Usage

Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit it to point to the relevant MQTT broker and topic that it should subscribe to.  Then run:

```
ruby mqtt-controller.rb config.yaml
```
