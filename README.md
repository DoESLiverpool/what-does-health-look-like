Eventbrite for running the event...  30?  Maybe some more to allow for drop-offs

Kids must be accompanied, and aged 8 and above.

Half-day?  1:30pm onwards

Bring a laptop (if you've haven't got one let us know beforehand and we'll see what we can work out).

If you want to, you can install Processing beforehand

Assume people are going to work in pairs.


## Shopping List

* Buy some microbits - 10 maybe?
* Velostat
* Reel of neopixels
* Crocodile clip leads
* Ways to attach things to people?  Velcro? 
* IR/ultrasonic distance sensor
* T-shirts?  One baby t-shirt

## Inputs...
Accelerometer on the microbit? - accelerometer attached to your shoe

Then choice from...

Velostat pressure sensor

Knitted stretch sensor https://tactile-electronics.tumblr.com/post/112332704495/textile-sensors-circular-knit-stretch-sensor-a - measure bicep curls, or knee bends
Light sensor on the microbit, and then enhance it with a IR/ultrasonic distance sensor - press-ups,

## Output...

Instantaneous feedback on the microbit - strip of neopixels

Stream numbers over serial to a serial monitor graph (written in processing)?

Have a couple of processing sketches to visualise data -

## Dancers...

Laura will incorporate some of the sensors into things to make them more robust for wearing, and will develop a few other sensors, which then feed data into the same visualisations.
