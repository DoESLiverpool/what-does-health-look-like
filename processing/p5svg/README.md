## Exporting SVGs for Tshirts

Example of SVG export from [Zenozeng](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg)

You can include the svg library script in the `index.html` that loads the sketch but you need to ensure it uses `v0.5.2` of processing 

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg/releases/download/v0.5.2/p5.svg.js"></script>
```

The example makes a big mass of circles based on `mouseX` and then downloads a `.svg` of it. You can then select all the circles and union them in Inkscape ready for vinyl or laser cutting.
